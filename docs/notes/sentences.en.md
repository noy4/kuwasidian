[University]

My major was called the Department of Art and Information Design.
It gave me a broad overview of media creation and information technology.
The program focused more on **hands-on projects** than lectures, which I liked.

[Work]
I'm a software engineer

Right now, I'm working on a project for the construction industry.
These days, construction companies usually create blueprints on computers.
And they want to make that process more efficient.  

For example, there’s a part where they have to label different building components — like putting “door” on doors and “window” on windows.  
Doing that over and over is really tedious, so they’re looking at using AI to automate it.

I'm developing a software extension to make that possible.


[How I got here]

About five years later, after I had left that company, he reached out saying he'd started a company in the Philippines and asked if I was interested in joining.
I said yes, and that's how I ended up here.


[Turning point]
When I was in university, I worried about myself and my future because I felt like I didn’t have anything I really wanted to do. Toward the end of my junior year, a friend of mine who was interning at a career-related company lent me a book called _The Mindset for Changing Careers_.

The book said that most people actually _don’t_ have a clear passion or dream—and that it’s totally fine. That line lifted a weight off my shoulders, because I’d always felt like I should have a clear goal. Instead, the book emphasized that people usually have an image of the kind of person they want to become, and that the hints for that are hidden in the life they’ve lived so far.

It suggested one way to figure out the person I wanted to become: give yourself a label.  
So I gave myself the label **“Creative Dragon”—a super creative individual.**  
Suddenly, everything felt clearer, like a fog had lifted. From that moment, it felt like my new life had begun. Now, I can decide what to do based on whether it brings me closer to that version of myself.


[My Core Values]
Becoming the person I want to be
Working toward the world I like

Living free
Staying mentally and intellectually strong
Being cool
Doing what feels meaningful


I thought about the meaning of life,
and realized there's no meaning at all.
I'm just a bunch of atoms,
a product of long, long natural selection.

If life has no meaning,
that's honestly sad and kind of frustrating.
But alright then—if that's how it is,
I'll be the one who decides what my life means.

If I'm going to die anyway, I'd rather leave something behind.
I want to do something fun, something interesting.
So I'll keep gathering whatever seems useful,
and keep living my life today, too.


[What I want to do in the future]
Someday I want my own studio or workspace where I can hide away, learn new things, and make stuff all day.
For example, I want to print things with a 3D printer,
work on electronics projects,
build web apps,
practice cooking,
and practice instruments.


[Hobbies & Interests]

**Music**
I prefer singing and playing rather than just listening. I tend to pick songs based on whether I want to sing them myself.

**Web Development**
I enjoy being able to build as much as I want for free. It’s like architecture without the material costs. I don’t mind doing the research or studying hard as long as it helps me implement a new feature.

[How I spend my days off]
I don't really have a 'weekend' mindset. I'm basically always working on web development—coding, researching, or studying. When I’m not doing that, I’m usually just on YouTube.


[Trip]
I’m the type of person who could spend all day on my laptop—honestly, I’d prefer it. But if I do that, I don’t talk to anyone and nothing ever happens. So, I force myself to change my environment just to make something happen.

[Food]
I’m not a huge foodie. I don’t like to spend much on meals; I just want something that's healthy and tastes good enough. I rarely eat chips—maybe twice a year. Chocolate is my absolute favorite, but I also like marshmallows and gummies.


[Where I live, where I have lived]
I’m living in Manila right now—specifically **Rockwell in Makati**. It’s a high-end area with a residence that’s **directly connected** to a mall. I didn't actually pick it myself; I asked someone to set up a place for me, and this is where I ended up. I don't plan on staying here too long, though.

Before this, I spent a long time using **housing subscriptions**. I’d move to a new spot every month or so, which was great because it kept the environment and the people around me fresh. There was **always something going on**, which I really liked.


[Family & partner]
I have one younger brother who’s three years younger than me. He’s living back home, working part-time, and is basically a total **gym rat**.

As for me, I’m single. I don't think I'm really **wired for romance**. If marriage happens, it happens, but I’m not really chasing it.


[Friends]
I’m mostly a **solo player**, so I rarely do things with friends. It’s not that I’m anti-social—I actually enjoy chatting or grabbing a bite with people I meet while traveling. I’d love to bond with others by working on a project together, but since I’m usually on my own, those chances are slim. I’m hoping to find a way to **loop people into** my creative work so we can hang out and collaborate.
