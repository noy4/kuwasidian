Right now, I'm working on a project for the construction industry.
These days, construction companies usually create blueprints on computers.

[Turning point]
When I was in university, I worried about myself and my future because I felt like I didn’t have anything I really wanted to do. Toward the end of my junior year, a friend of mine who was interning at a career-related company lent me a book called _The Mindset for Changing Careers_.

The book said that most people actually _don’t_ have a clear passion or dream—and that it’s totally fine. That line lifted a weight off my shoulders, because I’d always felt like I should have a clear goal. Instead, the book emphasized that people usually have an image of the kind of person they want to become, and that the hints for that are hidden in the life they’ve lived so far.

It suggested one way to figure out the person I wanted to become: give yourself a label.  
So I gave myself the label **“Creative Dragon”—a super creative individual.**  
Suddenly, everything felt clearer, like a fog had lifted. From that moment, it felt like my new life had begun. Now, I can decide what to do based on whether it brings me closer to that version of myself.

build web apps,
practice cooking,
and practice instruments.
