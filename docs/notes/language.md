### [How to Learn a Language in 6 Months by Chris Lonsdale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0yGdNEWdn0)

**5 Principles**
1) Focus on language content that is relevant to you.
2) Use your new language as tool to communicate from day 1.
3) When you first understand the message your will unconsciously acquire the language.
4) It's physiological training. (speak, listen)
5) Physiological state matters. (You're having fun, you're curious, relaxed)

**Actions you should take to learn a language**
1) Listen a lot.
2) Focus on getting the meaning first. (Learn by body language etc, patterns you already know).
3) Start mixing.
4) Focus on the core (Learn 1000 most used words, go for 3000 for pro level)
5) Get a language parent.
6) Copy the face.
7) Direct connect to mental images. (connect sounds, images, feeling with words)
